Amazing features:
Here basically travellers can create diaries with photos and captions .A person can just shake the phone and see all the foods , tourist
places etc posted by other travellers in his nearby surroundings .Any user can comment on any others post or give like to any post .The
most novel feature of this app is multiple contributor diary creation .Suppose three friends x,y and z have gone for a visit to usa .Then
they can create a diary together .Whatever they will post to their diary with their cellphone will be binded together in a single diary .
Not only that x can use wherever y and z are at any time in map .The same goes for y and z .Their is an emergency button there .If  
x faces any problem ,he/she can press the button and y and z will be notified through text messages with x's location to draw their 
attention .There is a little search engine behavior in the app .Let's suppose a user asked to look for diaries of newzealand .Then he will
see the diaries of newzealand .If the next time ,that same user enters the app ,he will see the diaries of newzealand without asking for 
it .So it saves the users' search history .If a user click on any photo ,he will see immediately in map where that photo was taken .There
are also many other amazing facilities like travel cost calculation ,nearby attraction finder etc .I used firebase database in the project.
The apk version is also given in the repository .I request to see the video demonstration file to see the amazing features of this app .
